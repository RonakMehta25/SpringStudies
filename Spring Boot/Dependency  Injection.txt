Dependency injection


The object dependencies that client needs are created by the spring.

Most common type of Spring Dependency:-

1. Constructor Injection
2. Setter Injection

1. Constructor Injection.

For injection of dependencies in constructor, specify the id of the object you want in your base class bean  as below :-

<bean id="" class="">
<constructor-arg ref="injected class id">
</bean>

While in case setter injection, we use as below

<bean id="" class="">
<property name="methodName" ref="id">
</bean>
