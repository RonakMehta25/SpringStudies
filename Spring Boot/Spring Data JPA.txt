Spring Data JPA

So we create DAO for employee . What if we have more object like books , cars etc. Do we need to repeat the code for all object. 

If we closely look at it . The only thing specific in the DAO for employee is the employee class and id.

That is Class type and ID.

What if I could give spring,any Class type and id then spring could return  all CRUD methods for free. Can we do that ?

Spring Data JPA project will help in that .

Just plug in your entity type and id then you have DAO

It provides JPArepository interface

Steps are

1. Make a employeeRepository Extend JPArepository<Class,Integer> interface without any implementation
2. Use it in application by using findAll and all other methods on employeeRepository
