Spring DAO

when you want to create DAO for your REST project, make a DAO interface.

Then you can create Hibernate or JAP implementation of it and pass it at runtime.

This way, if you change your implementation or add new implementation, you would be able to do it without minimal code change.

This interface contains all the methods that are needed in implementation of DAO layer
