Just like Spring Data JPA which helps to eliminate boilerplate code for DAO.

Can we do the same for REST API.

For example,for employee you created REST controller and service. So can there be a general code where you can just pass class and you get all methods for free.

it is Spring Data REST.

It gives all http methods and you just have to pass class and primary key.

To use SPring Data REST, just add the dependency, have entity class and create entityRepo extends JPARepository

We can do sorting , pagination and configuration

For exposing a resource with different endpoint , just use annotation RepositoryRestResource(path="members")

you can do sorting by using url?sort=firstName,lastName,desc
