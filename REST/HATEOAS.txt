HATEOAS

Hypermedia as engine of Application State

Here the response can contain link to other resource in the API.

Thus User/Client can discover other API through Base API.

Example.

For example, below given JSON response may be from an API like HTTP GET http://api.domain.com/management/departments/10

{
    "departmentId": 10,
    "departmentName": "Administration",
    "locationId": 1700,
    "managerId": 200,
    "links": [
        {
            "href": "10/employees",
            "rel": "employees",
            "type" : "GET"
        }
    ]
}
