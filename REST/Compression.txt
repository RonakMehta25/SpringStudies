Compression

Compression can be done by the server while replying to the request by the client.

The client should send which type of compression it supports. 

It specifies this information in accept-Encoding in head

GET        /employees         HTTP/1.1
Host:     www.domain.com
Accept:     text/html
Accept-Encoding:     gzip,compress


Now if the server does not support any of the encoding mentioned by client then server sends status code 406 (Not Acceptable)

Now when server compress the resource , it sends the compression type in content-encoding.
