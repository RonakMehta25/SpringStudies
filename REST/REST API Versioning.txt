REST API Versioning


Versioning of an API is done to prevent breaking of client integration.

APIs only need to be up-versioned when a breaking change is made. Breaking changes include:
	1.a change in the format of the response data for one or more calls
	2.a change in the response type (i.e. changing an integer to a float)
	3.removing any part of the API. 
	
Different ways of Versioning

1. Adding version in URI.
It can break client integration. Also it does not follow API guideline

2. Using Custom Request Header.


3. Using Accept Header.
